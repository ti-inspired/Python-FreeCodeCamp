# Print Function

To print data to be displayed on the terminal, you can use the "print" function:

```
print ("Hello world!")
```

You can also print multiple strings of data in the same line by separating the strings with commas. When using the ```print()``` function, there's no need to use spaces within the quotation marks because separating values with commas in ```print()``` automatically adds spaces between them.

###### Code:
```
print ("My favorite colors are","brown,","red,","and blue.")
```
Here, the string ```"My favorite colors are","brown,","red,","and blue."``` is an **argument** passed to the function **print**.

###### Output:
```
My favorite colors are brown, red, and blue.
```

# Variables

Feb 05, 2026

### Introduction
- To assign a value to a variable, use = ("assignment operator")
```
name = "John Doe"
age = 25
```
In the example above, John Doe is a string. **Strings** can be used with single or double quotes.

### Rules for Naming Variables
If any of the following rules are broken, you'll get the `SyntaxError`.
- Can only start with a letter or an underscore, but **never** a number
- Can contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores
- Variable names are case sensitive
- Names cannot be a keyword (ex: if, def, then, etc...)

### Common Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names
- **Snake Case:** names in lowercase separated by underscore(s)
  
  ```
  example_variable = 1
  ```
- Avoid using single variable names, such as "x"
  - Doesn't apply in loops, which use i, j, k

    ```
    x = 30
    ```

### Comments
- "#" symbol and the text following it on the line is a comment

  ```
  # Single line comment
  ```

  ```
  # This is
  # a comment using
  # multiple lines
  ```
- Remember from Microcontrollers: **COMMENT LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT**
